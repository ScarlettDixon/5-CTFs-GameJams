# 5-CTFs-GameJams
Code and descriptions from different CTFs, GameJams and other events competed in before and during my time at university. All files that are still accessible or have no security issues attached to them will be uploaded.

AFNOM - Covered several topics throughout the year at the birmingham university ethical hacking society, including many of the CTF events shown below, incredibly informative into many areas of the cyber security field and cemented much of the knowledge taugh within the university course modules. Topics during sessions included Network Forensics, Steganography, Reverse Engineering and Wifi Hacking.

BAE CTF 2020 - The most recent CTF challenge undertaken, unfortunately started during a period of assessments and so could not be given as much attention as desired.

---

CyberCrime 2019 - Team Underated - A set of varying challenges, some of which could be and were automated. The structure of the challenges wasn't as useful as some other CTFs (They were released days apart and at times not opportune to our team) but fun did occur

---

Hack the box - One of the two main systems used to learn the structures of penetration testing, more left to own devices and could become frustrating at times, but once other learning had been done the boxes became much easier to attack.

---
Tryhackme - The other main source of teaching, hints to the goal were given sporadically but felt much more structured for teaching than HTB, taking the user through the thought processes necessary for completion of each task.
HackBack2 2019 - Hosted by tryhackme, took part as team Underated and came 8th in the world and 1st at the university.

---

OvertheWire - The first major delve into the world of hacking and the methods of testing, continued to revise them several times as the years went on although some iterations were not recorded.

---

Virtual reality challenge 2017 - The category of best use of theme was was won by myself and two other team members for our "Revolution" game. 

---

Vulnhub - Attempted "Mr Robot" vulnerable VM but realised I still needed to develop my skills, came back to then attempt "Basic Pentesting" and had much more success.

---

24 Hour GameJam 2016 - I was still incredibly new to coding at this time, surrounded by veterans. I attempted to learn code from them and was very succesful. No code was created during this event.

---

48 Hour GameJam 2017 - No awards were won during this event but it helped form a more cohesive understanding of group dynamics.
